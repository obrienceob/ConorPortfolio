[Installation]
To get this webpage running, visit the website at https://obrienceob.github.io/ConorPortfolio/

If it is not on a github repository yet, you'll need a text editor. I reccomend VS Code. Download the zip file or code, or use GitHub's instructions to create a new repo. Uplaod the index.html, Develop folder with the script.js and style.css files to github using the git add, commit, and push commands.

Then ensure the file uploaded, open up the setting in your repo, and scroll down to the pages section. Change the source to "main" or "master" and save.
